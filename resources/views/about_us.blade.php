            <p class="lead"> BoolBnB was born in 2007 when five Hosts welcomed three guests to their Milan home, and has since grown to over 4 million Hosts who have welcomed 1.4 billion guest arrivals in almost every country across the globe. Every day, Hosts offer unique stays and experiences that make it possible for guests to connect with communities in a more authentic way.
